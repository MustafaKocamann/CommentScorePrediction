    "BEST DINER IN THE COUNRTY!!! We've been to many famous diners across the country and we still give Gab and Eat the best rating !! I was a little intimidated when I first walked in and there was like 2 pounds of butter just sitting on top of the homefires on the grill. If you are looking for a healthy breakfast they probably can accomodate you, but Everything I ate was clearly the opposite of healthy. After trying like every meal they have I would recommend the mix grill(half unless you are sharing) adding cajun seasoning with the texas toast. Burgers are great too.\n\nIt's hard to find a place that makes a better breakfast than you could make by yourself at home, but this place does it. The atmosphere is classy, old school Americana.",
    "best place ever!"
